```{r}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
penguins
```
```{r}
names(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```
In the penguins, there are 8 catagories, which are"species","island", "bill_length_mm",bill_depth_mm","flipper_length_mm","body_mass_g", "sex" and "year". There are 344 entries which mean 200.9152. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=penguins,aes(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm,color= species)) +
  geom_point()
```
